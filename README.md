# JavaPrintNumbers
this is just a basic java file to print a number
Step one: Save mainfile.java on your computer as a Java file (.java file extension)
Step two: Create a folder and name it whatever you want
Step three: Create a folder inside that folder called src. I will provide the next step with e.g. Javacode as the folder name that parents src. And just imagine your Javacode folder is inside your Desktop. the "YOURUSER" will be your user as an example.
Step 4: Go into terminal (on windows, i'm not making a linux or mac version cuz i don't know how) and type cd C:\Users\YOURUSER\OneDrive\Desktop\Javacode\src
Step 5: Install the Java JDK (it's free) or install OpenJDK (which is also free) and go to your Path environment variable and add one with the directory C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-24\bin
Step 6: If your terminal is still open, type javac mainfile.java 
  If it is not still open, repeat step 4.
Step 7: Type jar cfe mainfile.java mainfile
